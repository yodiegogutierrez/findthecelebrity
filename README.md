# Find The Celebrity

Project for technical interview

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites

This project works with Java 8 and Maven

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

# A couple of Maven commands

Once you have configured your project in your IDE you can build it from there. However if you prefer you can use maven from the command line. In that case you could be interested in this short list of commands:

* `mvn compile`: it will just compile the code of your application and tell you if there are errors
* `mvn test`: it will compile the code of your application and your tests. It will then run your tests (if you wrote any) and let you know if some fails
* `mvn install`: it will do everything `mvn test` does and then if everything looks file it will install the library or the application into your local maven repository (typically under <USER FOLDER>/.m2). In this way you could use this library from other projects you want to build on the same machine

If you need more information please take a look at this [quick tutorial](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
